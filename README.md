==================
Mailing List Server

1- Simple setup and installation. Most of the existing installations are very complex because they have too many options that are never used.

2- Easy personalization- the code must not only be parameterized, but clean, simple and well-structured to allow teamwork and encourage developers to tweak it and adapt it easily.

3- The FROM sender must be personalized, since it's very important for the user to subscribe to an individual/corporate entity, not to a list -this is fundamental for marketing.

4- In order to comply with the privacy laws, the 'subscribe' and 'unsubscribe' options must require a confirmation and identity check.

5- Regarding the newsletters' sending process, there must be a command that reads "send this page" through which the administrator will send a URL to the server. Then, the server will send this page after it has been properly coded through email.

6- It must be compatible with the standard packages and modules of a "debian stable" version since, in the future, it will be integrated in this SOP.

7- It must generate statistics about everything: bounces, reads, visits, clicks... in order to be able to use the control panel with this information. Ideally, an XML file with the data will be sent in order to avoid excessively using DDBB in the queries.
